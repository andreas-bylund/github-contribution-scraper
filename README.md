# Github Contribution Scraper 
Suggestion how a scraper for downloading user contribution for the course "Projekt i software engineering G1F, 15 hp" at University of Sk√∂vde can look like. 

# Functionality 
+ Fetches data from the Github API and stores it to a Sqlite database 
+ Uses an array that contains usernames of participants on the course 
+ If the script have used all the API calls the script will go to sleep and wait until the script have API calls to use again.

# Limitations
+ This scripts follows Github's API limitations. This means that the script can use as much as 60 requests per hour.
# Example output
